-- A) Employees in the IT department

-- A1) Get the id of the IT department, then query the employee table
-- prendi mostra il dipartimento IT
select department_id
from department
where name = 'IT';

-- mostra i dipendenti che hanno department_id it (6)
select concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as IT
from employee
where department_id = 6;

-- A2) Same, but with a join
select concat(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) as IT
from employee e join department d
using (department_id)
where d.name = 'IT';

-- A3) Same, but with a subquery
select concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as IT
from employee
where department_id in (
	select department_id
	from department
	where name = 'IT'
);

-- B) Who is the John Chen's manager?

-- B1) Given the manager id ...
select manager_id

-- It is easy to write a plain query to get Nancy Greenberg
select concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as Manager

-- B2) Same, but using a self join
select concat(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) as Manager
from employee e join employee m
on e.manager_id = m.employee_id
where e.first_name = 'John' and e.last_name = 'Chen';

select concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as Manager
from employee
where employee_id = (
	select manager_id
	from employee
	where first_name = 'John' and last_name = 'Chen');

-- B4) safer version using "in" and checking for null
select concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as Manager
from employee
where employee_id in (
	select manager_id
	from employee
	where first_name = 'John' and last_name = 'Chen' and manager_id is not null);
